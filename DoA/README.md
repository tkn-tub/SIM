# Direction of Arrival Estimator (DoA)
This project evaluates the performance of an FFT-based algorithm for estimating the DoA as implemented in a stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM).

## Description
This project develops the FFT algorithm on an SIM to evaluate its performance for detecting the direction of arrival (DoA) of a mobile user.
